This assignment was originally intended to be run using I/O redirection as detailed in the included PDF. To simplify running the program I have included 2 shell scripts to run the program without having to open the command prompt. 
	getByID will generate a HTML which uses student ID as the labels
	getByName will generate a HTML which uses student NAME as the labels
